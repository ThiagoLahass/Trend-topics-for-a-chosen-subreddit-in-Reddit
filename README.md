# Trend-topics-for-a-chosen-subreddit-in-Reddit
Create an application that generates trend topics for a chosen subreddit.

### The project idea is quite simple:
- Create an application that generates trend topics for a chosen subreddit.
- Your program should take as input:
    - A subreddit, for example: https://www.reddit.com/r/skincancer/
    - A start and end date
    - A number N of words for ranking
- Your program should output:
    - The top N most commented words in the period (from highest to lowest) saved in JSON format
    - An image with a word cloud for the most frequent words in the period (not necessarily the top N)
